# portfolio-site
Personal portfolio/resume website built using Django

By Zane Alumbaugh

## Description

The goal of this site was to show I am competent with Django as well as to have a centralized location to show off my personal projects, resume, and updates. 

The site has 3 Django applications: projects, updates, and home. I chose to use the application model so that website content could be easily updated/edited using Django's admin panel rather then having to edit HTML and CSS files.
